Empirical Experiment on solving IGL problem in the context of BloodHound

[TODO]
1. randmize the percentage of blockable edges   [check]
2. implement algorithm 1 and test
3. test the implementation of cost function
4. finish build_graph, neo4j_builder (can wait)
5. merge read_graph, store_graph, draw as a class
6. entry point could be any nodes except DA
7. make add_new_attributes more convienient
   list append自动触发对应的计算函数
